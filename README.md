# To Do's
Simple To Do's app in React.

## Description
The user can add easily add new, non-duplicate to do's to the list. Entering a duplicate task prevents the user from inserting it. Tasks can then be marked as done or deleted. At the bottom of the list, the user can find a total count of undone tasks, and a button toggling view between done and undone tasks. Bulma provides a smooth user interface, while all logic is handled in TypeScript.
